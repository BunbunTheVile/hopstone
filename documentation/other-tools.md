## 5e.tools
- rule library (races, classes, feats, etc.)
- vast reference of adventures and books (is this legal?)
- bestiary with lots of custom content
- loot and stat generators (generators in general are probably fun)
- PWA functionality with content downloads

## Other Ideas
- some sort of shared user space (chats, groups, friends)
	-> Wizards probably won't like this
- guided character generation
- shared campaign notebook
	- search function
	- alerts
	- pinning
	- semi-private notes (only between a few players)
	- non-DM area
